Demonstration of environment signals and pattern compatibility 
as described in Section 1.5 of the manual.

Key elements:
 - A finite set of environment states E (e.g., "envA", "envB", "envC").
 - Each environment e has a set of signals: SignalSet[e].
 - Patterns each have a finite set of features:
     feature_map[x] = {f1, f2, ...}
 - Compatibility: a pattern x is compatible with environment e 
   if feature_map[x] âŠ† SignalSet[e].

We also show how grains-coded probabilities can be updated when transitioning 
from one environment to another.
