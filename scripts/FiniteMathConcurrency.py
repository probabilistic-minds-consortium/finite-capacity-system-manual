"""
Grains-Coded Concurrency Manager:
An example script demonstrating how to manage concurrency 
in a microservices or tasks environment using grains-coded (finite) increments,
dynamic vantage refinement, and discrete scaling steps.

Key Points:
  - Concurrency is stored as a grains-coded fraction or a vantage-based integer.
  - Capacity refinements occur in discrete leaps (multiplying concurrency by an integer factor).
  - We track 'load pressure' as a finite integer representing a fraction.
  - Concurrency expansion is strictly bounded â€“ no reliance on any notion of infinity.
  - Each vantage step is validated to ensure stable, finite updates.
